⚙️ DevOps Principles We Follow

Our team applied several core DevOps principles throughout Part 1:

1. Lean Principles
	•	Reduce waste (avoid redundant work, small iterative commits)
	•	Improve flow (short sprints, continuous integration)
	•	Quick feedback loops (frequent testing + early integration)

2. Collaboration & Communication
	•	Daily communication in group chat
	•	Stand-up meetings twice a week
	•	Transparent task tracking using Jira/Asana

3. Automation Mindset
	•	Consistent Git branch creation
	•	Template-based PRs and Issues
	•	GitHub labels + milestones for automated categorisation

4. Continuous Integration
	•	All features developed in isolated branches
	•	Merged into dev only after PR review
	•	Integrated early to prevent conflicts

5. TDD Influence

While Part 1 did not require full automated testing, we adopted the mindset:
	•	Define test cases upfront
	•	Develop backend logic to meet test expectations
	•	Validate success and error scenarios manually

🧭 Project Methodology

We used a hybrid “Scrumban” approach
	•	Scrum elements:
	•	6 structured sprints
	•	Stand-ups
	•	Clear sprint goals
	•	Iterative delivery
	•	Kanban elements:
	•	Visual board (To Do → In Progress → Done)
	•	Continuous task flow
	•	Easy tracking of responsibilities

Why Scrumban?
	•	Perfect for a small 3-person team
	•	Flexible enough for real-time changes
	•	Still structured enough to meet deadlines

🔀 GitFlow Strategy

We follow a clean and industry-standard GitFlow model:

Primary Branches
	•	main → stable, production-ready branch
	•	dev → integration branch (all features merge here first)

Feature Branch Pattern

Each member uses:

feature/<name>-<feature-name>

Examples:

feature/angel-delete-book
feature/alisha-retrieve-book
feature/maria-add-book

Pull Request Workflow
	1.	Create feature/* branch
	2.	Commit with meaningful messages
	3.	Push to GitHub
	4.	Open Pull Request → merge into dev
	5.	DevOps Lead (Angel) reviews + resolves conflicts
	6.	After Sprint 4 testing → merge dev → main

🏃 Sprint Structure (Jira Scrum Board)

We used 6 sprints, each aligned with DevOps stages:

Sprint 1 – Setup & Planning

Repo creation, JSON structure, wireframes, templates, Asana/Jira setup

Sprint 2 – Feature Development

Each developer builds ONE feature:
	•	Add Book (Maria)
	•	Retrieve Book (Alisha)
	•	Delete Book (Angel)

Sprint 3 – Integration & Version Control

Link frontend scripts, connect APIs, debug combined flow

Sprint 4 – Testing & Debugging

Validate:
	•	success case
	•	missing/empty input
	•	invalid or duplicate entries
Fix issues before merging

Sprint 5 – SCM & Documentation

Git screenshots, GitHub labels/milestones, README, report sections

Sprint 6 – Presentation & Submission

Slides, demo walkthrough, final LMS submission
